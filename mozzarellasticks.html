        <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://sugarspunrun.com/mozzarella-sticks-recipe/">Place panko crumbs in a Ziploc bag and use a rolling pin or mallet to crush until you have fine crumbs</a></li>
        <li>Pour crushed panko into a shallow dish and add Italian seasoning, parsley, garlic powder, pepper, and salt and stir to combine</li>
        <li>In a separate, shallow bowl, crack 2 large eggs and beat with a whisk or the tines of a fork until scrambled</li>
        <li>Pour all-purpose flour in yet another shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>If using a mozzarella block, cut widthwise into 15 sticks.</li>
        <li>Working with one at a time, dip the stick in the flour and shake off any excess flour. Then dip in the beaten egg and let any excess drip off. Finally, dip in panko crumb mixture, making sure the entire cheese stick is coated with panko.</li>
        <li>Place a wire cooking rack on a baking sheet and place breaded mozzarella sticks on rack. Once all sticks have been dipped, transfer to the freezer and chill for at least one hour. If you are chilling for longer than 1 hour, after 1 hour remove from freezer and place in an airtight container then return to freezer.</li> <img src="https://sugarspunrun.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Homemade-Mozzarella-Sticks-Recipe-2-of-5.jpg" height="300" width="200">
